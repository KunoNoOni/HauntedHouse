Haunted House 

For the Oct #1GAM challenge I decided to recreate the Atari 2600 game Haunted House. The cartridge itself contains 9 games to play. Each game is a little bit different from the original.

Game 1 is considered the Tutorial game, as when you play there are only 3 enemies and you can see the walls.
Game 2 starts the real games. 3 enemies and you cannot see the wall.
Game 3 is like game 2 but add locked doors. The master key is in the room you start in.
Game 4 is like game 3 but the master key is in a random room
Game 5 is like game 4 but adds 2 additional spiders for a total of 5 enemies chasing you.
Game 6 is like game 5 but adds the ability for the ghost to move through locked doors
Game 7 is like game 6 but adds the ability for the bat to move an object your hold to another room if it touches you
Game 8 is like game 7 but the ghost is not affected by the scepter and all the enemies move faster
Game 9 is the ultimate challenge! Its like game 8 but the floor plan is random each time you play. This means the stairs on each level change from game to game. Not only that but locked doors will not stop the enemies!

This was my most ambitious game to date! As such, there were many concepts I'd not done before and it literally took me to entire month to create just Game 1! I was able to add Game 2 in as well, but right now I'm on borrowed time. See you have 96 hours past the end of the month to finish and upload your game. I'm already 2 days into this time and rather than rush to complete more games I've decided to upload what I have done and then next year when I have more time I will go back and complete the other 7 missing games.


I really hope I've captured the spirit of the original game. I have such respect for those programmers of 6502 ASM. They do so much in so little room. 

I hope you enjoy :)
